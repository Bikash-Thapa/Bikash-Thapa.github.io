- Hi! I'm Bikash Thapa, and I am currently a PhD student at Old Dominion University (ODU) majoring in Computer Science.

- I am a member of the Applied Privacy Engineering and Science (APES) Lab at ODU under the supervision of [Professor Jonathan Takeshita](https://jtakeshi.github.io). At APES Lab, we conduct research into practical aspects of digital privacy and computer security.

- My main research interests lie in the field of applied cryptography, data security and privacy including Fully Homomorphic Encryption and Trusted Hardware.

- Before joining ODU, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, Tribhuvan University,  Nepal in 2022.
